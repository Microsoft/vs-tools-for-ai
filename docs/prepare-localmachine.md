# Preparing development environment

Before training deep learning models on your local or remote computer you should make sure you have the latest applicable prerequisites installed. This includes making sure the latest drivers and libraries for your NVIDIA GPU (if you have one). You should also ensure you have installed Python and Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, Python support for Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code, and appropriate deep learning frameworks such as Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK), TensorFlow, Caffe2, MXNet, Keras, Theano, PyTorch and/or Chainer.

> [!NOTE]

> Software introduction in the following subsectons is excerpted from their homepages.

## NVIDIA GPU driver, CUDA and cuDNN

### NVIDIA GPU driver

Deep learning frameworks take advantage of NVIDIA GPU to let machines learn at a speed, accuracy, and scale towards true artificial intelligence. If your computer has NVIDIA GPU cards, please visit [here](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) or try OS update to install the latest driver.

### CUDA

[CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone) is a parallel computing platform and programming model invented by NVIDIA.
It enables dramatic increases in computing performance by harnessing the power of the GPU.
Currently, CUDA Toolkit 8.0 is required by deep learning frameworks.

To install CUDA

- Visit this [site](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-80-ga2-download-archive), download CUDA and install it.
- Make sure to install the CUDA runtime libraries, and then add CUDA binary path to the %PATH% or $PATH environment variable.
- On Windows, this path is "C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0\bin" by default.

### cuDNN

[cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) (CUDA Deep Neural Network library) is a GPU-accelerated library of primitives for deep neural networks by NVIDIA. cuDNN v6 is required by latest deep learning frameworks.

To install cuDNN
- Visit [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-download) to download and install the latest package.
- Ensure to add the directory containing cuDNN binary to the %PATH% or $PATH environment variable.
- On Windows, you can copy cudnn64_6.dll to "C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v8.0\bin".

> [!NOTE]
>
> Previous deep learning frameworks such as CNTK 2.0 and TensorFlow 1.2.1 need cuDNN v5.1.
> However, you can install multiple cuDNN versions together.


## Python

Python has been the primary programming language for deep learning applications.
**64-bit** Python distribution is required, and the latest [Python 3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-354/) is recommended for the best compatibility.

Please add Python directory to the %PATH% or $PATH environment variable.
You also need to install **pip**, which is the package management system to install and manage software packages written in Python.
Deep learning frameworks rely on pip for their own installation.

> [!NOTE]
>
> 1. On Windows, it is preferred to install the Python launcher for yourself only.
> 2. If your Python distribution is installed in the system directory (e.g. the one shipped with Visual Studio 2017), administrative permission is required to install Python packages with pip.

![install Python on Windows](./media/prepare-local-machine/install_python_win.png)

Then, we verify whether Python is installed correctly, and upgrade pip to the latest version.
Suppose Python 3.5 is installed, please execute the following commands in a terminal:

- **Windows**

```cmd
C:\>python -V
Python 3.5.4

C:\>pip3 -V
pip 9.0.3 from c:\users\test\appdata\local\programs\python\python35\lib\site-packages (python 3.5)

C:\>python -m pip install -U pip
```

- **macOS**

```bash
MyMac:~ test$ python3 -V
Python 3.5.4

MyMac:~ test$ pip3 -V
pip 9.0.3 from /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/site-packages (python 3.5)

MyMac:~ test$ python3 -m pip install -U pip
```

- **Linux**

```bash
test@MyLinux:~$ python3 -V
Python 3.5.4

test@MyLinux:~$ pip3 -V
pip 9.0.3 from /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages (python 3.5)

test@MyLinux:~$ sudo python3 -m pip install -U pip
```

## Working with Python in Visual Studio on Windows

Visual Studio provides [open-source](https://github.com/Microsoft/ptvs) support for the Python language through the Python development and Data Science workloads (Visual Studio 2017) and the free Python Tools for Visual Studio extension (Visual Studio 2015 and earlier).
Learn more about [Working with Python in Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/python/python-in-visual-studio) for more details.

### Visual Studio 2017

When Visual Studio 2017 installation starts, please choose **Python development** workload for Python language support.

Note that a 64-bit Python 3.6 will also be installed automatically.
If you have installed Python 3.5, please refer to the following "Setting up the default Python environment" subsection.

![Working with Python in Visual Studio 2017](./media/prepare-local-machine/install_python_tools_vs2017.png)

### Visual Studio 2015

When Visual Studio 2015 installation starts, please choose **Custom** type, and then select **Python Tools for Visual Studio**.

![Working with Python in Visual Studio 2015](./media/prepare-local-machine/install_python_tools_vs2015.png)

### Setting up the default Python environment

Users need to setup the default Python environment in Visual Studio for AI projects if there are multiple ones.
E.g. Users install Python 3.5 manually, and Visual Studio 2017 Python development workload installs a 64-bit Python 3.6 automatically.
Or users create several Anaconda virtual Python environments.

To set the default Python environment globally for Visual Studio, please go to menu ***Tools > Python > Python Environments*** (Visual Studio 2017), or ***Tools > Python Tools > Python Environments*** (Visual Studio 2015).
Then, select e.g. **Python 3.5 (64 bit)** and click ***Make this the default environment for new projects*** button.
