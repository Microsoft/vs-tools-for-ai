# Visual Studio Tools for AI

[简体中文](docs/zh-hans)

Visual Studio Tools for AI is an extension to build, test, and deploy Deep Learning / AI solutions. It seamlessly integrates with Azure Machine Learning for robust experimentation capabilities, including but not limited to submitting data preparation and model training jobs transparently to different compute targets. Additionally, it provides support for custom metrics and run history tracking, enabling data science reproducibility and auditing. Enterprise ready collaboration, allow to securely work on project with other people.

Get started with deep learning using [Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK)](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cognitive-toolkit), [Google TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org), or other deep-learning frameworks today.
